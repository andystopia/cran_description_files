Description: Given the non-negative data and its distribution, the package estimates the rank parameter for Non-negative Matrix Factorization. The method is based on hypothesis testing, using a deconvolved bootstrap distribution to assess the significance level accurately despite the large amount of optimization error. The distribution of the non-negative data can be either Normal distributed or Poisson distributed.
