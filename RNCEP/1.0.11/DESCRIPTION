Description: Contains functions to retrieve, organize, and visualize weather data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis (<https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html>) and NCEP/DOE Reanalysis II (<https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html>) datasets.  Data are queried via the Internet and may be obtained for a specified spatial and temporal extent or interpolated to a point in space and time.  We also provide functions to visualize these weather data on a map.  There are also functions to simulate flight trajectories according to specified behavior using either NCEP wind data or data specified by the user.
