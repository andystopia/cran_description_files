Description: Compare color palettes with simulations of color vision deficiencies - deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia.
        It includes calculation of distances between colors, and creating summaries of differences between a color palette and simulations of color vision deficiencies.
        This work was inspired by the blog post at <http://www.vis4.net/blog/2018/02/automate-colorblind-checking/>.
