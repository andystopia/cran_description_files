Description: Provides statistical tools for 
	analyzing net and relative survival, with a key feature 
	of relaxing the assumption of independent censoring and 
	incorporating the effect of dependent competing risks. 
	It employs a copula-based methodology, specifically the 
	Archimedean copula, to simulate data, conduct survival 
	analysis, and offer comparisons with other methods. 
	This approach is detailed in the work of 
	Adatorwovor et al. (2022) <doi:10.1515/ijb-2021-0016>.
