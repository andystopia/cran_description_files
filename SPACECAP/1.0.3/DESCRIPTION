Description: SPACECAP is a user-friendly software package for
        estimating animal densities using closed model
        capture-recapture sampling based on photographic captures using
        Bayesian spatially-explicit capture-recapture models. This
        approach offers advantage such as: substantially dealing with
        problems posed by individual heterogeneity in capture
        probabilities in conventional capture-recapture analyses. It
        also offers non-asymptotic inferences which are more
        appropriate for small samples of capture data typical of
        photo-capture studies.
