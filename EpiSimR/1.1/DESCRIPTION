Description: The 'EpiSimR' package provides an interactive 'shiny' app based on deterministic compartmental 
    mathematical modeling for simulating and visualizing the dynamics of epidemic and endemic disease spread. 
    It allows users to explore various intervention strategies, including vaccination and isolation, 
    by adjusting key epidemiological parameters. The methodology follows the approach described by 
    Brauer (2008) <doi:10.1007/978-3-540-78911-6_2>. Thanks to 'shiny' package.
