Title: A Generic Convex-Hull-Based Model Selection Method
Version: 3.0.1
Depends: igraph, graphics, plotly, shiny, shinythemes, stats, methods,
        R (>= 2.10), DT
Description: Given a set of models for which a measure of model (mis)fit and model complexity is provided, CHull(), developed by Ceulemans and Kiers (2006) <doi:10.1348/000711005X64817>, determines the models that are located on the boundary of the convex hull and selects an optimal model by means of the scree test values.
