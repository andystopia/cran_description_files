Description: Fit, summarize and plot sinusoidal hysteretic processes using:
    two-step simple harmonic least squares, ellipse-specific non-linear least
    squares, the direct method, geometric least squares or linear least squares. See 
    Yang, F and A. Parkhurst, "Efficient Estimation of Elliptical Hysteresis with 
    Application to the Characterization of Heat Stress" <DOI:10.1007/s13253-015-0213-6>.
