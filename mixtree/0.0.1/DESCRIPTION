Description: Statistical framework for comparing sets of trees using hypothesis testing methods. Designed for transmission trees, phylogenetic trees, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), the package implements chi-squared tests to compare edge frequencies between sets and PERMANOVA to analyse topological dissimilarities with customisable distance metrics, following Anderson (2001) <doi:10.1111/j.1442-9993.2001.01070.pp.x>.
