Description: Contains functions useful for debugging, set operations on vectors,
    and 'UTC' date and time functionality. It adds a few vector manipulation 
    verbs to 'purrr' and 'dplyr' packages. It can also generate an R file to 
    install and update packages to simplify deployment into production. The 
    functions were developed at the data science firm 'Numeract LLC' and are 
    used in several packages and projects.
