Description: Implements an efficient algorithm for solving sparse-penalized support vector machines with kernel density convolution. This package is designed for high-dimensional classification tasks, supporting lasso (L1) and elastic-net penalties for sparse feature selection and providing options for tuning kernel bandwidth and penalty weights. The 'dcsvm' is applicable to fields such as bioinformatics, image analysis, and text classification, where high-dimensional data commonly arise. Learn more about the methodology and algorithm at Wang, Zhou, Gu, and Zou (2023) <doi:10.1109/TIT.2022.3222767>.
