Description: A joint mixture model has been developed by Majumdar et al. (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.17511> that integrates information from gene expression data and methylation data at the modelling stage to capture their inherent dependency structure, enabling simultaneous identification of differentially methylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites and differentially expressed genes. The model leverages a joint likelihood function that accounts for the nested structure in the data, with parameter estimation performed using an expectation-maximisation algorithm.
