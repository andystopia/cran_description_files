Description: Detecting and visualizing nonlinear interaction effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms or epistatic interactions, especially high-order epistatic interactions, are important topics in bioinformatics because of their significant mathematical and computational challenges. We present CINOEDV (Co-Information based N-Order Epistasis Detector and Visualizer) for detecting, visualizing, and analyzing high-order epistatic interactions by introducing virtual vertices into the construction of a hypergraph. CINOEDV was developed as an alternative to existing software to build a global picture of epistatic interactions and unexpected high-order epistatic interactions, which might provide useful clues for understanding the underlying genetic architecture of complex diseases.
