Description: Provides basic tools for computing clusters of instances described by multiple time-to-event censored endpoints. From long-format datasets, where one instance is described by one or more records of events, a procedure is used to compute state matrices. Then, from state matrices, a procedure provides optimised computation of the Jaccard distance between instances. The library is currently in development, and more options and tools allowing graphical representation of typologies are expected. For methodological details, see our methodological paper: Delord M, Douiri A (2025) <doi:10.1186/s12874-025-02476-7>.
