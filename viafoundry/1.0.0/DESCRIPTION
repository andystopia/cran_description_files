Description: 'Via Foundry' API provides streamlined tools for interacting with and extracting data from structured responses, particularly for use cases involving hierarchical data from Foundry's API. It includes functions to fetch and parse process-level and file-level metadata, allowing users to efficiently query and manipulate nested data structures. Key features include the ability to list all unique process names, retrieve file metadata for specific or all processes, and dynamically load or download files based on their type. With built-in support for handling various file formats (e.g., tabular and non-tabular files) and seamless integration with API through authentication, this package is designed to enhance workflows involving large-scale data management and analysis. Robust error handling and flexible configuration ensure reliable performance across diverse data environments. Please consult the documentation for the API endpoint for your installation.
