Title: Improved Techniques to Estimate Trend, Velocity and Acceleration
        from Sea Level Records
Version: 1.0
Depends: R (>= 3.2.2)
Date: 2016-01-11
Description: Analysis of annual average ocean water level time series
    from long (minimum length 80 years) individual records, providing improved
    estimates of trend (mean sea level) and associated real-time velocities and
    accelerations. Improved trend estimates are based on Singular Spectrum Analysis
    methods. Various gap-filling options are included to accommodate incomplete time
    series records. The package also contains a forecasting module to consider the
    implication of user defined quantum of sea level rise between the end of the
    available historical record and the year 2100. A wide range of screen and pdf
    plotting options are available in the package.
