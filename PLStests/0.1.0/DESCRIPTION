Title: Model Checking for High-Dimensional GLMs via Random Projections
Version: 0.1.0
Maintainer: Wen Chen <tlqdcw@gmail.com>
Description: Provides methods for testing the goodness-of-fit 
    of generalized linear models (GLMs) using random projections. It is 
    specifically designed for high-dimensional scenarios where the number 
    of predictors substantially exceeds the sample size. The statistical 
    methodologies implemented in this package are detailed in the paper by 
    Wen Chen and Falong Tan (2024, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2412.10721>).
