Description: The 'hydReng' package provides a set of functions for hydraulic engineering tasks and natural hazard assessments. It includes basic hydraulics (wetted area, wetted perimeter, flow, flow velocity, flow depth, and maximum flow) for open channels with arbitrary geometry under uniform flow conditions. For structures such as circular pipes, weirs, and gates, the package includes calculations for pressure flow, backwater depth, and overflow over a weir crest. Additionally, it provides formulas for calculating bedload transport. The formulas used can be found in standard literature on hydraulics, such as Bollrich (2019, ISBN:978-3-410-29169-5) or Hager (2011, ISBN:978-3-642-77430-0).
