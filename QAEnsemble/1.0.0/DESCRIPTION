Description: The Ensemble Quadratic and Affine Invariant Markov chain Monte 
    Carlo algorithms provide an efficient way to perform Bayesian inference in 
    difficult parameter space geometries. The Ensemble Quadratic Monte Carlo 
    algorithm was developed by Militzer (2023) <doi:10.3847/1538-4357/ace1f1>. 
    The Ensemble Affine Invariant algorithm was developed by Goodman and Weare 
    (2010) <doi:10.2140/camcos.2010.5.65> and it was implemented in Python by 
    Foreman-Mackey et al (2013) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1202.3665>. The Quadratic 
    Monte Carlo method was shown to perform better than the Affine Invariant 
    method in the paper by Militzer (2023) <doi:10.3847/1538-4357/ace1f1> and 
    the Quadratic Monte Carlo method is the default method used. The Chen-Shao 
    Highest Posterior Density Estimation algorithm is used for obtaining 
    credible intervals and the potential scale reduction factor diagnostic is 
    used for checking the convergence of the chains.
