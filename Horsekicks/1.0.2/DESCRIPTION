Description: We provide extensions to the classical dataset "Example 4:
             Death by the kick of a horse in the Prussian Army" first
	           used by Ladislaus von Bortkeiwicz in his treatise on
	           the Poisson distribution "Das Gesetz der kleinen Zahlen",
	           <DOI:10.1017/S0370164600019453>.  As well as an
	           extended time series for the horse-kick death data, we also
             provide, in parallel, deaths by falling from a horse and by
	     drowning.
