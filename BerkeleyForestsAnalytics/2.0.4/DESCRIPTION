Description: A suite of open-source R functions designed to produce standard 
    metrics for forest management and ecology from forest inventory data. The 
    overarching goal is to minimize potential inconsistencies introduced by the 
    algorithms used to compute and summarize core forest metrics. Learn more 
    about the purpose of the package and the specific algorithms used in the
