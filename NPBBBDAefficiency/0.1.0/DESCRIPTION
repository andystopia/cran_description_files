Description: Nested Partially Balanced Bipartite Block (NPBBB) designs involve two levels of blocking: (i) The block design (ignoring sub-block classification) serves as a partially balanced bipartite block (PBBB) design, and (ii) The sub-block design (ignoring block classification) also serves as a PBBB design. More details on constructions of the PBBB designs and their characterization properties are available in Vinayaka et al.(2023) <doi:10.1080/03610926.2023.2251623>. This package calculates A-efficiency values for both block and sub-block structures, along with all parameters of a given NPBBB design.
