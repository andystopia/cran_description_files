Description: The package implements linear mixed effect model splines for
    modelling and differential expression for highly dimensional data sets:
    investNoise for quality control and filterNoise for removing
    non-informative trajectories; lmmSpline to model time course expression
    profiles and lmmsDE performs differential expression analysis to identify
    differential expression between groups, time and/or time x group
    interaction.
