Description: The package implements linear mixed effect model splines for
    modelling and differential expression for highly dimensional data sets:
    lmmSpline to models time course expression profiles and lmmsDE performs
    differential expression analysis to identify differential expression
    between groups, time and/or time x group interaction.
