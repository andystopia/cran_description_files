Description: Linear Mixed effect Model Splines ('lmms') implements linear mixed
    effect model splines for modelling and differential expression for highly
    dimensional data sets: investNoise() for quality control and filterNoise() for
    removing non-informative trajectories; lmmSpline() to model time course expression
    profiles and lmmsDE() performs differential expression analysis to identify
    differential expression between groups, time and/or group x time interaction.
