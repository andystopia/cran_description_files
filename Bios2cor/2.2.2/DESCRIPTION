Description: Utilities for computation and analysis of correlation/covariation in multiple sequence alignments and in side chain motions during molecular dynamics simulations. Features include the computation of correlation/covariation scores using a variety of scoring functions between either sequence positions in alignments or side chain dihedral angles in molecular dynamics simulations and utilities to analyze the correlation/covariation matrix through a variety of tools including network representation and principal components analysis. In addition, several utility functions are based on the R graphical environment to provide friendly tools for help in data interpretation. Examples of sequence covariation analysis are provided in: (1) Pele J, Moreau M, Abdi H, Rodien P, Castel H, Chabbert M (2014) <doi:10.1002/prot.24570> and (2) Taddese B, Deniaud M, Garnier A, Tiss A, Guissouma H, Abdi H, Henrion D, Chabbert M (2018) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006209>. An example of side chain correlated motion analysis is provided in: Taddese B, Garnier A, Abdi H, Henrion D, Chabbert M (2020) <doi:10.1038/s41598-020-72766-1>.
