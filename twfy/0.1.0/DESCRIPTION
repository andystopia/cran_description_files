Description: An R wrapper around the API of TheyWorkForYou, a parliamentary 
    monitoring site that scrapes and repackages Hansard (the UK's parliamentary 
    record) and augments it with information from the Register of Members' 
    Interests, election results, and voting records to provide a unified 
    source of information about UK legislators and their activities. See 
    <http://www.theyworkforyou.com> for details.
