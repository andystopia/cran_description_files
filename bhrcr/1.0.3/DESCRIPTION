Description: An implementation of the Bayesian Clearance Estimator (Fogarty et al. (2015) <doi:10.1111/biom.12307>).
            It takes serial measurements of a response on an individual (e.g., parasite load 
            after treatment) that is decaying over time and performs Bayesian hierarchical 
            regression of the clearance rates on the given covariates. This package provides 
            tools to calculate WWARN PCE (WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network's 
            Parasite Clearance Estimator) estimates of the clearance rates as well. A tutorial appeared in
            Sharifi-Malvajerdi et al. (2019) <doi: 10.1186/s12936-018-2631-8>.
