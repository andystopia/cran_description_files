Description: Implementation of the Hysteretic and Gatekeeping Depressions Model (HGDM) which calculates variable connected/contributing areas and resulting discharge volumes in prairie basins dominated by depressions ("slough" or "potholes"). The small depressions are combined into a single "meta" depression which explicitly models the hysteresis between the storage of water and the connected/contributing areas of the depressions. The largest (greater than 5% of the total depressional area) depression (if it exists) is represented separately to model its gatekeeping, i.e. the blocking of upstream flows until it is filled. The methodolgy is described in detail in Shook and Pomeroy (2025, <doi:10.1016/j.jhydrol.2025.132821>).
