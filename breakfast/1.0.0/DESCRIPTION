Title: Multiple Change-Point Detection and Segmentation
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Piotr", "Fryzlewicz", email = "p.fryzlewicz@lse.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: The breakfast package performs multiple change-point detection in data
    sequences, or sequence segmentation, using computationally efficient multiscale
    methods. This version of the package implements the "Tail-Greedy Unbalanced Haar",
    "Wild Binary Segmentation" and "Adaptive Wild Binary Segmentation" change-point
    detection and segmentation methodologies. To start with, see the function
    segment.mean.
