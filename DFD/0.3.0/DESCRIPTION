Description: Get Drug information from given differential expression profile. The package search for the bioactive compounds from reference databases such as LINCS containing the genome-wide gene expression signature (GES) from tens of thousands of drug and genetic perturbations (Subramanian et al. (2017) <DOI:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049>).
