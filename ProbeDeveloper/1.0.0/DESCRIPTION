Description: This tool can develop hybridization probes for target sequences based on melting temperature value calculated by R package 'TmCalculator' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TmCalculator> and methods extended from Beliveau, B. J.,(2018) <doi:10.1073/pnas.1714530115>, and those hybridization probes can be used to capture specific target regions in fluorescence in situ hybridization and next generation sequence experiments.
