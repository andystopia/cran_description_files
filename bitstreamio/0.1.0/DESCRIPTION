Description: Bit-level reading and writing are necessary when dealing with 
  many file formats e.g. compressed data and binary files.  Currently, R 
  connections are manipulated at the byte level.  This package wraps existing
  connections and raw vectors so that it is possible to read bits, bit sequences,
  unaligned bytes and low-bit representations of integers.
