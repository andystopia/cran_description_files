Description: Calculate with spectral properties of light sources, materials, cameras, eyes, and scanners.
    Build complex systems from simpler parts using a spectral product algebra. For light sources,
    compute CCT, CRI, SSI, and IES TM-30 reports.  For object colors, compute optimal colors and Logvinenko coordinates.
    Work with the standard CIE illuminants and color matching functions, and read spectra from 
    text files, including CGATS files.  Estimate a spectrum from its response. A user guide and 9 vignettes are included.
