Description: Performs cryptographic randomness tests on a sequence of random integers or bits. Included tests are greatest common divisor, birthday spacings, book stack, adaptive chi-square, topological binary, and three random walk tests. Tests except greatest common divisor and birthday spacings are not covered by standard test suites. In addition to the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, results of Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Jarque-Bera tests are also generated by some of the cryptographic randomness tests.
