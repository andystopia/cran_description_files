Description: Performs cryptographic randomness tests on a sequence of random integers or bits. Most of the included tests are not covered by standard test suites. In addition to the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, results of Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Jarque-Bera tests are also generated by some of the cryptographic randomness tests. Additionally, it includes two functions for the calculation of greatest common divisor and the Stirling numbers of the second kind.
