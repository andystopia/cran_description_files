Description: Performs cryptographic randomness tests on a sequence of random
    integers or bits. Included tests are greatest common divisor, birthday spacings,
    book stack, adaptive chi-square, topological binary, and three random walk
    tests. Tests except greatest common divisor and birthday spacings are not
    covered by standard test suites. In addition to the chi-square goodness-of-fit
    test, results of Anderson-Darling, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Jarque-Bera tests are
    also generated by some of the cryptographic randomness tests.
