Description: A Gibbs sampler algorithm was developed to estimate change points in constant-wise data sequences while performing clustering simultaneously. The algorithm is described in da Cruz, A. C. and de Souza, C. P. E "A Bayesian Approach for Clustering Constant-wise Change-point Data" <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2305.17631>.
