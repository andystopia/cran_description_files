Description: Captures errors encountered when running 'run_examples()', and processes and archives them. The function 'run_examples()' within the 'devtools' package allows batch execution of all of the examples within a given package. This is much more convenient than testing each example manually. However, a major inconvenience is that if an error is encountered, the program stops and does not complete testing the remaining examples. Also, there is not a systematic record of the results, namely which package functions had no examples, which had examples that failed, and which had examples that succeeded. The current package provides the missing functionality.
