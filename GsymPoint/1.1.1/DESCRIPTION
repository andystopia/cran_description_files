Description: Estimation of the cutpoint defined by the Generalized Symmetry point in a binary classification setting based on a continuous diagnostic test or marker. Two methods have been implemented to construct confidence intervals for this optimal cutpoint, one based on the Generalized Pivotal Quantity and the other based on Empirical Likelihood. Numerical and graphical outputs for these two methods are easily obtained.
