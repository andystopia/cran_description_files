Description: Network meta-analysis for survival outcome data often involves several studies only involve dichotomized outcomes (e.g., the numbers of event and sample sizes of individual arms).  To combine these different outcome data, Woods et al. (2010) <doi:10.1186/1471-2288-10-54> proposed a Bayesian approach using complicated hierarchical models. Besides, frequentist approaches have been alternative standard methods for the statistical analyses of network meta-analysis, and the methodology has been well established. We proposed an easy-to-implement method for the network meta-analysis based on the frequentist framework in Noma and Maruo (2025) <doi:10.1101/2025.01.23.25321051>. This package involves some convenient functions to implement the simple synthesis method.
