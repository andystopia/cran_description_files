Description: Facilitates the creation of 'xpose' data objects from Nonlinear Mixed
      Effects (NLME) model outputs produced by 'Certara.RsNLME' or Phoenix NLME. This
      integration enables users to utilize all 'ggplot2'-based plotting functions available
      in 'xpose' for thorough model diagnostics and data visualization. Additionally, the 
      package introduces specialized plotting functions tailored for covariate model
      evaluation, extending the analytical capabilities beyond those offered by 'xpose' alone.
