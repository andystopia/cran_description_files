Description: Framework for the implementation of solvency related computations based on 
             standard models for the Swiss Solvency Test (SST), a risk-based capital standard for Swiss 
             insurance companies. Allows Monte Carlo simulation of market risk, some insurance risks and 
             their aggregation. Additional toolbox for preprocessing computations. Convenient 'shiny' GUI 
             combined with a parser for an input 'excel' (.xlsx) template to simplify model configuration, 
             data fill-in and results visualization.
