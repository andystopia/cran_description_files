Title: Structural Additive Cumulative Intensity Models with IV

Description: An instrumental variable estimator under structural cumulative additive intensity model is fitted, that leverages initial randomization as the IV. The estimator can be used to fit an additive hazards model under time to event data which handles treatment switching (treatment crossover) correctly. We also provide a consistent variance estimate.
