Description: Provides functions to run statistical analyses on
    surface-based neuroimaging data, computing measures including cortical
    thickness and surface area of the whole-brain and of the hippocampi.
    It can make use of 'FreeSurfer', 'fMRIprep' and 'HCP' preprocessed
    datasets and 'HippUnfold' hippocampal segmentation outputs for a given
    sample by restructuring the data values into a single file. The single
    file can then be used by the package for analyses independently from
    its base dataset and without need for its access.
