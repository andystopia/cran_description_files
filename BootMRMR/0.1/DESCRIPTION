Description: Selection of informative features like genes, transcripts, RNA seq, etc. using Bootstrap Maximum Relevance and Minimum Redundancy technique from a given high dimensional genomic dataset. Informative gene selection involves identification of relevant genes and removal of redundant genes as much as possible from a large gene space. Main applications in high-dimensional expression data analysis (e.g. microarray data, NGS expression data and other genomics and proteomics applications).
