Description: We provide several avenues to predict and account for user-based mortality and tag loss during mark-recapture studies. When planning a study on a target species, the retentionmort_generation() function can be used to produce multiple synthetic mark-recapture datasets to anticipate the error associated with a planned field study to guide method development to reduce error. Similarly, if field data was already collected, the retentionmort() function can be used to predict the error from already generated data to adjust for user-based mortality and tag loss. The test_dataset_retentionmort() function will provide an example dataset of how data should be inputted into the function to run properly. Lastly, the retentionmort_figure() function can be used on any dataset generated from either model function to produce an 'rmarkdown' printout of preliminary analysis associated with the model, including summary statistics and figures. Methods and results pertaining to the formation of this package can be found in McCutcheon et al. (in review, "Predicting tagging-related mortality and tag loss during mark-recapture studies").
