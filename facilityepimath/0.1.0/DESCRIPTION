Description: Calculate useful quantities for a user-defined differential equation
    model of infectious disease transmission among individuals in a healthcare
    facility. Input rates of transition between states of individuals with and
    without the disease-causing organism, distributions of states at facility
    admission, relative infectivity of transmissible states, and the facility length
    of stay distribution. Calculate the model equilibrium and the basic facility
    reproduction number, as described in Toth et al. (2025)
