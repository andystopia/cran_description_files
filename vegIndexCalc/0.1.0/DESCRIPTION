Description: It provides a comprehensive toolkit for calculating a suite of common vegetation indices (VIs) derived from remote sensing imagery. VIs are essential tools used to quantify vegetation characteristics, such as biomass, leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic activity, which are essential parameters in various ecological, agricultural, and environmental studies. Applications of this package include biomass estimation, crop monitoring, forest management, land use and land cover change analysis and climate change studies. For method details see, Deb,D.,Deb,S.,Chakraborty,D.,Singh,J.P.,Singh,A.K.,Dutta,P.and Choudhury,A.(2020)<doi:10.1080/10106049.2020.1756461>. Utilizing this R package, users can effectively extract and analyze critical information from remote sensing imagery, enhancing their comprehension of vegetation dynamics and their importance in global ecosystems. The package includes the function vegetation_indices().
