Description: Package implements entropy balancing, a data preprocessing procedure described in Hainmueller (2008, <doi:10.1093/pan/mpr025>) that allows users to reweight a dataset such that the covariate distributions in the reweighted data satisfy a set of user specified moment conditions. This can be useful to create balanced samples in observational studies with a binary treatment where the control group data can be reweighted to match the covariate moments in the treatment group. Entropy balancing can also be used to reweight a survey sample to known characteristics from a target population.
