Description: Implements a novel predictive model, Partially Interpretable Estimators (PIE), which jointly trains an interpretable model and a black-box model to achieve high predictive performance as well as partial model. See the paper, Wang, Yang, Li, and Wang (2021) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2105.02410>.
