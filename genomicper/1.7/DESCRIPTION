Description: Circular genomic permutation approach uses genome wide association studies (GWAS) results to establish the significance of pathway/gene-set associations whilst accounting for genomic structure(Cabrera et al (2012) <doi:10.1534/g3.112.002618>). All single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GWAS are placed in a 'circular genome' according to their location. Then the complete set of SNP association p-values are permuted by rotation with respect to the SNPs' genomic locations. Two testing frameworks are available: permutations at the gene level, and permutations at the SNP level. The permutation at the gene level uses Fisher's combination test to calculate a single gene p-value, followed by the hypergeometric test. The SNP count methodology maps each SNP to pathways/gene-sets and calculates the proportion of SNPs for the real and the permutated datasets above a pre-defined threshold. Genomicper requires a matrix of GWAS association p-values and SNPs annotation to genes. Pathways can be obtained from within the package or can be provided by the user.
