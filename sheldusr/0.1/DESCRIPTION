Title: Natural disaster losses for the USA from the SHELDUS database
Description: The Spatial Hazard Events and Losses Database in the United States
    (SHELDUS, http://www.sheldus.org), from the University of South Carolina,
    is a database on human and property losses from natural disasters in the
    United States. This database includes County-level information on property
    losses, crop losses, injuries and fatalities from 18 different types of
    natural hazards from about 1960 to the present. Although the data is free,
    downloading the data is tedious and so is cleaning and analysing it. This
    package comes with the entire SHELDUS data and includes functionality for
    data extraction and analysis.
