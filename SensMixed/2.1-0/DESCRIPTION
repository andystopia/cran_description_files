Description: Functions that facilitate analysis of 
              Sensory as well as Consumer data within a mixed effects model 
              framework. The so-called mixed assessor models, 
              that correct for the scaling effect are implemented.
              The generation of the d-tilde plots forms part of the package.
              The shiny application provides a GUI for the functionalities.
