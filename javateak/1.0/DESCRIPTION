Title: Javanese Teak Above Ground Biomass Estimation
Description: Simplifies the process of estimating above ground biomass components for teak trees using a few basic inputs, based on the equations taken from the journal "Allometric equations for estimating above ground biomass and leaf area of planted teak (Tectona grandis) forests under agroforestry management in East Java, Indonesia" (Purwanto & Shiba, 2006) <doi:10.60409/forestresearch.76.0_1>. This function is most reliable when applied to trees from the same region where the equations were developed, specifically East Java, Indonesia. This function help to estimate the stem diameter at the lowest major living branch (DB) using the stem diameter at breast height with R^2 = 0.969. Estimate the branch dry weight (WB) using the stem diameter at breast height and tree height (R^2 = 0.979). Estimate the stem weight (WS) using the stem diameter at breast height and tree height (R^2 = 0.997. Also estimate the leaf dry weight (WL) using the stem diameter at the lowest major living branch (R^2 = 0.996).
