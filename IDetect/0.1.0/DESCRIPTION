Description: Provides efficient implementation of the Isolate-Detect
    methodology for the consistent estimation of the number and location of multiple 
    change-points in one-dimensional data sequences from the "deterministic 
    + noise" model. For details on the Isolate-Detect methodology, please see Anastasiou and
    Fryzlewicz (2018) <https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/24cdcc_6a0866c574654163b8255e272bc0001b.pdf>.
    Currently implemented scenarios are: piecewise-constant signal with Gaussian
    noise, piecewise-constant signal with heavy-tailed noise, continuous piecewise-linear 
    signal with Gaussian noise, continuous piecewise-linear signal with heavy-tailed noise.
