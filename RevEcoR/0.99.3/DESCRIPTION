Description: An implementation of the reverse ecology framework. Reverse ecology
    refers to the use of genomics to study ecology with no a priori assumptions
    about the organism(s) under consideration, linking organisms to their
    environment. It allows researchers to reconstruct the metabolic networks and
    study the ecology of poorly characterized microbial species from their
    genomic information, and has substantial potentials for microbial community
    ecological analysis.
