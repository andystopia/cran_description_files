Description: Long non-coding RNAs identification and analysis. Default models are trained with human, mouse and wheat datasets by employing SVM. Features are based on intrinsic composition of sequence, EIIP value (electron-ion interaction pseudopotential), and secondary structure. This package can also extract other classic features and build new classifiers. Reference: Han S., et al. (2019) <doi:10.1093/bib/bby065>.
