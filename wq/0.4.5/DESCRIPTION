Description: Functions to assist in the processing and exploration of data from
    environmental monitoring programs. The package name stands for "water quality" 
    and reflects the original focus on time series data for physical and 
    chemical properties of water, as well as the plankton. Intended for programs 
    that sample approximately monthly at discrete stations, a feature of many 
    legacy data sets. Most of the functions should be useful for analysis of 
    similar-frequency time series regardless of the subject matter.
